# ml_demo
Some language classification with Python and scikit-learn

## Running the Demo
To try it out, unzip svm.zip in the repo directory, then run `predict_language.py`. It will prompt you to input some text, then attempt to guess the language of the input text.

## Ok but I want to do some machine learning
You can play around with the training code by first installing the dependencies:
* NumPy
* Pandas
* scikit-learn
* seaborn

On Linux you can run:
`sudo apt-get install python-numpy python-scipy python-matplotlib ipython ipython-notebook python-pandas python-sympy python-nose`
to get most of them, and use pip to get scikit-learn:
`pip install -U scikit-learn`
and seaborn:
`pip install seaborn`
